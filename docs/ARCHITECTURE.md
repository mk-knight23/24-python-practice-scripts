# Architecture: 24-python-practice-scripts

## Overview
A comprehensive technical education platform for Python engineering. It features a React 19 frontend structured as a "Developer Lab," enabling organized practice of data structures, algorithms, and advanced security protocols.

## Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: React 19
-   **Build Tool**: Vite 6
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion 12
-   **Core Interface**: Responsive Laboratory HUD with real-time progress tracking.

## Core Logic
-   **Lesson Orchestrator**: High-performance state management for switching between specialized curriculum modules (Binary Search, Quicksort, etc.).
-   **Script Output Simulator**: Syntax-highlighted lab environment for previewing and verifying Python script logic.
-   **Mastery Tracking**: Integrated SVG-based progress visualization with telemetry for script completion and test success.
-   **Practice Streak Engine**: Engagement module tracking consecutive days of technical training.

## Performance
-   Native React 19 rendering for instant lesson transitions and UI responsiveness.
-   Tailwind v4 native architecture for minimal JIT overhead in complex hub layouts.
-   Advanced Framer Motion 12 layouts for fluid "HUD-style" sidebar interactions.
